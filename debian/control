Description: dynamic tiling window manager
 Scrotwm is a minimalistic window manager that tries to stay out of the way so
 that valuable screen real estate can be used for much more important stuff.
 .
 It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language to do any
 configuration.
 .
 It was written by hackers for hackers and it strives to be small, compact
 and fast.
