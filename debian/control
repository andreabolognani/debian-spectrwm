Description: dynamic tiling window manager
 spectrwm is a minimalistic window manager that tries to stay out of the
 way so that valuable screen real estate can be used for much more
 important stuff.
 .
 It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language to do
 any configuration.
 .
 It was written by hackers for hackers and it strives to be small,
 compact and fast.
