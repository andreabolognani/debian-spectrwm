scrotwm (0.9.20-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Closes: #531790 (focus changes to the window in the background
      sometimes).
    - Closes: #531826 (doesn't play well with hidden windows).
    - Closes: #532569 (dialogs are always displayed on the first screen in
      a multi-head setup).
  * 002-check-before-preloading-libswmhack.diff:
    - libswmhack.so is installed now, so this patch is no longer needed.
  * 003-dont-use-hypen-as-minus-sign.diff:
    - merged upstream; dropped.
  * 102-remove-bash-and-openbsd-assumptions.diff:
    - call top correctly.
  * 103-try-versioned-dlopen.diff:
    - make libswmhack.so work even when libx11-dev and libxt-dev are not
      installed. Closes: #551732 (unable to run some applications because
      of LD_PRELOAD=/usr/.../libswmhack.so.0.0 in the environment).
  * Convert to 3.0 (quilt) source format.
  * Document patches according to DEP-3.
